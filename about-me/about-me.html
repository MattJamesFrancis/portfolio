      <!-- short personal bio -->
      <p>Originally from the Pacific Northwest, I attended college at Eastern Washington University. As a student of EWU's Electronic Media &amp; Film Program, I wrote, shot, and directed multiple short films that were granted screening at a wide range of international film festivals. Throughout college, I also worked as a cinematographer for the university athletic department and completed a studio production internship at ESPN. For the last two years, I've been working as a freelance videographer/editor for a variety of clients including medical manufacturing companies, the non-profit sector, musical artists, and fashion entrepreneurs.</p>
